      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>The aim of this marketing campaign is to promote the brand Peluche and reach the desired target audience - women aged between 18 and 25, who are interested in buying luxury products at a cheaper price. The message that we want to distribute is “Feel luxurious without spending a fortune!”. For that purpose, we decided to use social media platforms Instagram and Facebook, as we found that those platforms are most popular amongst our target audience as mentioned in the Media Tactics and also most feasible for our execution. We were also thinking of using TikTok instead of Facebook, but figured that we do not have enough experience in making video content, therefore decided to stick with sharing our message though pictures. On those platforms, we used mostly the feed post and story features to distribute our ideas and bring awareness to our brand. In the stories, we also used some interactive elements like polls and quizes to let our followers engage with our brand more. On average, 10-14 accounts took part of the quizzes and polls, while the story posts reached around 40 people. We shared the same kind of content on both of the platforms, but soon figured, that on Instagram, we reached a wider audience of people who saw our content and  engaged with it. </p>
      <p>Our reach objectives for Instagram were to reach 50 people to see our content by the 10th of April. As of 8th of April, we have reached 169 accounts, with 46 accounts that engaged with the seen content. Therefore, we reached this objective. However, we are not sure if all of those people are in our target audience.</p>
      <p>On Facebook, we wanted to reach 25 people to see our content by the 10th of April. As of … of April, we have reached … people, therefore, we … this objective.</p>
      <p> For response objectives, we wanted people to engage with our content, which we managed to reach as we gained followers who liked our posts and took part in the interactive stories. Although one of our response objectives was also to attract people visit our website, it was under construction during the promotion campaign period, therefore we couldn't reach that objective, but as soon as the website is ready, we will continue to promote it and people can find in our Instagram and Facebook pages. However, we were able to tease and inform our target audience what the brand is about with the social media posts. </p>





      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>As previously mentioned, we used Instagram and Facebook to execute our marketing campaign. Something that we learned from this experience was that Instagram works great for such campaign as it is more popular amongst our target audience and it is easier to promote a brand and gain audiences on this site. Therefore, people are more likely to see our posts on this platform as they might end up in the Explore page, or people will share them in their personal stories. However, what we could have done differently is that we could have made more interactive stories as people seemed to really like them. Additionally, we should have made more stories in general - perhaps have a story post every day - as this way people are more likely to see our content, recognise our brand, and will not forget about us. In fact, story posts are more reacable to the app users as they are at the top of the page, where it is easy to see them, while feed posts might get lost in other content by the accounts, that the users are following.</p>
      <p> Something else that we learned during the execution was that Facebook was not a very good platform where we could promote our brand. We did not gain lots of people who liked our page, therefore our engagement rate was also low - our posts got only couple of likes and did not get as much attention as we would have wanted to. However, we kind of expected it as we knew that it was easier to reach our target audience and gain awareness for our brand page on Instagram than on Facebook, but we still wanted to try how the execution would work on that platform regardless. What we could have done differently if we wanted to focus more on this platform was that we could have made special posts, that would fit better with Facebook and their own users, instead of using the same posts and stories that we made for Instagram. Additionally, the season why we probably did not gain as much engagement on our Facebook page, was the lack of promotion. as we focused more on promoting our Instagram page. This is something we can learn from - also promote the Facebook page more. </p>
      <p> However, in general, we probably should have used some other platforms instead of Facebook, for example TikTok, as this video-sharing platform is also hugely successful and popular amongst our target audience. There it is also easier to gain followers, engagement, and brand awareness, as the videos could end up in any kind of user’s For You Page (similar to Instagram’s Explore page) at any time. </p>





      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>During the project, we managed to distribute our message, share our values, and promote our brand mainly through Instagram but also on Facebook through feed posts and stories. The execution went well as we reached …all… of our objectives. If the project would continue, we would of course, keep sharing posts about our brand but also do more stories on Instagram - perhaps every day or every other day while also include stories with interactive features like polls, question tabs, and quizes to keep our audiences engaged with our brand. Additionally, we would now start distributing ur website more and raise awareness to that. We can do that by adding the link to our Instagram bio (and other platforms that we are using), but also inform our followers that the website is published by distributing the link on Instagram/Facebook stories and make a post that people can visit the website and buy our perfume there. Therefore, we will also start and keep promoting our perfume, so people would buy it.</p>
      <p>For future recommendations, we would suggest to promote the brand on other platforms as well, for example TikTok or even make a short commercial and share it on YouTube. On all of the platforms where the brand would be promoted, it would be possible to use paid advertising to reach an even wider audience.</p>
      <p>What we would do differently is that we would change our chosen social media platfroms - still keep Instagram, but change Facebook to, for example, TikTok, as we figured that Facebook is not the best place where to gain audiences and raise awareness about a brand. However, if we still want to keep on using Facebook, it would also help if we would simply promote the page more and invite people to like it. But on the platforms that we would use, we should be more active and post more often. Additionally, in the future we should use more hashtags on our posts. Even though we mentioned in our Media Tactics that we will use them, we did not this time. However, using hashtags would have probably helped us gain more engagement in our posts.</p>
